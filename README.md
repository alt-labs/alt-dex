## [Use case 2] — DEX Token Swap, Liquidity and Stake Pools

The main goal of this project is to get onboarded into the Plutus smart contract ecosystem, and gain full understanding of it's mechanics of the UTxO transaction model.

The project should make available the following functionality  that can be consumed by the WebUI:

* Swap a particular tokens pair within a pre-made liquidity pool
* Add liquidity to a pool

Some of the work part of this project is based on the plutus-use-cases AltSwap example from the official Plutus repo.

## Challenges

While working on this project, as our objective was to abstract away the complexity related to working directly with smart contracts to as many developers as possible.

This will allow a large number of users to be onboarded to the ecosystem as building DApps using NT's would be simpler, but at the latter stages of development we realized that in order for us to acomplish that mission substantial work related to scaling the PAB is necessary.

## Next steps - Phase 2

In the second phase our objective is to focus on scaling the PAB, this can be done in a couple of ways, depending on how wallets will be managed.

The scope of this phase is to:
* Research and document the different strategies for scaling the PAB
* Implement a solution that would allow a large number of users to interact with the PAB
* Work related to the integration of the PAB & wallet management
* Test setup on different hardware configurations
* Benchmark & publish results of PAB running on different configurations

## CodeBase

There are 2 distinct areas of this codebase:

* **Plutus Contracts & PAB server**
  `pab/Main.hs` — is the executable source that wraps the PAB web server.
  `src/**`  — contains the Plutus contracts, helper functions and type definitions.
  `specs/**` — HSpec tests folder (TODO)

* **Web-UI**
  Located in the `web-ui` directory, it contains the stencil UI for consuming the PAB endpoints using a web browser.

## Setup

1. Clone the official plutus repository
2. Check out the `plutus-pab/v0.0.2` comit
3. Enter nix-shell
4. Change to dex-token-swap directory
5. Run `cabal update`

(Example):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/plutus.git
cd plutus
git checkout plutus-pab/v0.0.2

# Enter nix shell
nix-shell

# Change to AltLabs/dex-token-swap
cabal update
```

### Build & Run (PAB)

```bash
# Build
cabal build exe:alt-dex-pab

# Run PAB (Servant Webserver API) by default on port 8080
cabal exec -- exe:alt-dex-pab
```

### Verify PAB is operating properly

Here's an example of running and interacting with this contract via the API. For this it will help if you
have `jq` installed.

Check what contracts are present:

```
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/new/contract/definitions | jq
```

You should receive a list of contracts and the endpoints that can be called on them, and the arguments
required for those endpoints.

#### Endpoints

Users of the `AltSwap` contract have the following **endpoints** *consumable*:

* `create` — Creates a liquidity pool for a pair of coins. The creator provides liquidity for both coins and gets liquidity tokens in return.

  Each Liquidity pool creates another UTXO with a different token from the factory (state token) each time a pool is created a new token is minted
  **source: **`src/AltDex/Contracts/OffChain.hs`

* `close` — Closes a liquidity pool by burning all remaining liquidity tokens in exchange for all liquidity remaining in the pool.
  **source: **`src/AltDex/Contracts/OffChain.hs`

* `swap` — Uses a liquidity pool two swap one sort of coins in the pool against the other.

  **source: **`src/AltDex/Contracts/OffChain.hs`

* `add` — Adds some liquidity to an existing liquidity pool in exchange for newly minted liquidity tokens.
  **source: **`src/AltDex/Contracts/OffChain.hs`

* `remove` — Removes some liquidity from a liquidity pool in exchange for liquidity tokens.
  **source: **`src/AltDex/Contracts/OffChain.hs`

#### `start` endpoint
The `start` endpoint is unique in a sense, that it's invoked during the PAB boot and it shuldn't be consumable by the user for this case. It creates a altswap *Factory*

This *Factory* will keep track of the <u>existing</u> **liquidity pools** and enforce that there will be at most one liquidity pool  for any pair of tokens at any given time. It keeps such record by the use of DATUM in the UTxO. Internally it invokes `forgeContract` from `Currency.hs` which defines and makes use of the `OneShotCurrency` data type for making of the NFT, which can uniquely identify the *Factory*.

#### Data Types

*(src/AltDex/Contracts/Data.hs)*

Important to note here are data types used by validators which are `AltSwapAction` and `AltSwapDatum` which are used to represent the *Redeemer* and *Datum* in the UTxO.

##### JSON types

All data types ending with *Params (eg. CreateParams) contain the structure that the consumable JSON api endpoints expect.

## User Contract Endpoints

After the PAB has started a AltSwap "Factory" contract is started. The instance of this contract is later on used to parametrize the endpoints consumable by the end user.

### 1 — Create Liquidity Pool

The first step is to consume the "Factory" output via the User ` create` endpoint to create a new liquidity pool. The Factory UTXO keeps a track of the list of pools in it's DATUM, which is updated whenever a new pool is created.

### 2 — Add Liquidity

To add liquidity one must invoke the User contract's `add` endpoint, which produces the following Tx outputs:

### 3 — Swap

To swap token eg. A for B, there is a `swap` endpoint on the User contranct instance.

### 4 — Remove

To withdraw tokens from a pool there is a `remove` endpoint on the User contract instance, which takes the liquidity shares amount as an input.

### 5 — Close

The `close` endpoint on the user contranct instance, closes a liquidity pool by burning all remaining liquidity tokens in exchange for all liquidity remaining in the pool.

## Test Specs

### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests simply run:

```bash
cabal test
```

for more coloured output use `--test-show-detail` flag:

```bash
cabal test --test-show-details=direct
```

### Integration Tests

Scenarios for creating / adding / swapping / closing will be covered via a python script that calls the PAB endpoints.

```bash
python3 bin/test.py
```
